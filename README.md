# tetryen-blender
shape construction, uses blender 4.1 and sverchok nodes

Why this shape is significant? It is the empty space within the packed spheres, made from flower of life pattern. 
Specifically, spheres have centers on each vert of a tetrahedron for added dimension


DISCLAIMER: this had leaked geometry from each of the points, probably from circle resolution, I clipped it off with booleans
Feel free to make better or use shape however you want, it is free; unlicenced.
